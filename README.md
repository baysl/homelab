# üè° Homelab

Welcome to my personal homelab, fully managed via GitOps.
This repository contains the complete configuration of my multi-node K3s cluster, maintained using FluxCD.

I'm constantly learning and improving this setup.

## üß± Stack Overview

- **Kubernetes**: [K3s](https://k3s.io) (multi-node setup)
- **GitOps**: [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io)
- **CNI**: Flannel
- **Ingress Controller**: [NGINX Ingress](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)
- **Storage**: [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io) (with replication and snapshots)
- **DNS**: Static entries in `/etc/hosts` (for now)
- **Remote access**: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)

## üöÄ How It Works

1. Cluster bootstrapped manually with `k3s`
2. FluxCD manages HelmReleases and Kustomizations
3. Each application lives in `clusters/homelab/apps/<app-name>`
4. Ingress routing is done via `nginx` with per-app Ingress definitions
5. PVCs are backed by Longhorn with default 3x replication
6. Secrets are encrypted, but I don't use an external Vault
